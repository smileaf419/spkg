Bash based package manager

A Poorly written package manager roughly based around Gentoo's Portage.
Most packages if they exist within portage are in the same locations to aid in package updates.

This is not intended as more than a playground for learning about package management,
Toying with Cross compilation, etc.

This is not intended to compete with Gentoo's portage or any distribution.
Speed of the package manager is not a priority but rather simplicity in use and development of package files.
