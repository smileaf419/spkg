## TODO: make a config dir and drop in symlinks to these config files within our version dir.
## Doing this would allow a server to be upgraded without a completely new map/config to be created.
## IMPORTANT: Doing so however would create a potential upgrade issue if the user ever wanted to downgrade servers

## the Server Jar can be stored within a different directory Allowing for a vanilla or modded versions to be installed at the same time.

## Create an init script so we can have our server autostart.
