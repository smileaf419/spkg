# Circular Dependency These need to be installed before harfbuzz
# BUT support in each need harfbuzz installed first.
# These dependencies should be considered *BEFORE* harfbuzz
# But the logic should NOT be within these packages themselves.
# This is the culprit of the circular dependencies and those dependencies should still have harfbuzz as a dependency.
# Without those packages requiring harfbuzz, harfbuzz won't be pulled into the dependency tree resulting in a lost dependency and harfbuzz getting cleaned.
